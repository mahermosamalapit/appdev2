Your Role:
I was assigned the role of UI/UX designer in our team, and I can confidently say that I contributed to the responsibilities expected of a designer. I am someone who is open to all suggestions, especially when they are aimed at improving the project. The only challenges I faced in this role were related to my experience with Figma. I wasn't initially familiar with many of the techniques Figma offers, so I ended up searching for solutions and manually creating designs that could have been automated. For example, I created rows on a page using horizontal lines instead of using tables or plugins designed for that purpose. Despite this, I learned a lot along the way. I discovered other features and techniques in Figma, which expanded my knowledge and experience as a designer in our team.

Teamwork Experience:
I can say that I’ve learned a lot from my team, especially from their different perspectives and the knowledge they bring to the table. Each of them excels in their own role. I can confidently say that we perform our tasks well, but there are times when conflicts arise. These conflicts once occur because we don't always recognize the efforts of our team members in certain tasks. It’s unintentional, but to maintain professionalism, it’s important that we communicate effectively to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.

Personal Growth and Discipline:
I want to refine my prototyping and interaction design skills, focusing on creating more interactive and high-fidelity prototypes that align with user needs. Collaboration with developers is another thing I’d like to improve, ensuring smoother communication and more feasible designs. Also managing my time effectively will help me avoid procrastination and meet deadlines without sacrificing creativity.
