Assignment #1: Expectations for this Semester
Objective:
This assignment helps you reflect on your goals for this backend development course. By understanding your expectations, I can better tailor the course to meet your needs.
1. Introduction 
To be honest, I have only learned a few programming languages, such as MySQL, JavaScript, Python, and Java. These are the languages I discovered during my studies at La Verdad Christian College. While I’ve learned some of them, I haven't fully mastered any of them. At times, I realized that learning a programming language felt too complex for me, and I doubted whether I was really good at it. I didn’t see myself as someone for whom programming would be a strong suit. However, I am still grateful that I managed to survive it and get through the challenges by the end of my school years.
Although I haven’t yet experienced backend development, I have worked with frontend development. This school year, I am aiming to learn a backend development this school year through the help of this subject
2. Course Expectations 
This course offers a wealth of knowledge that not only enhances technical skills but also fosters the development of essential soft skills such as communication, leadership, and problem-solving. Throughout this course, I’ve realized that it’s not just about learning to code, but also about discovering which aspects of technology ignite my passion and where I can apply my strengths. One of the key things I’ve learned is the importance of exploring various areas within the tech field, as it helps to refine what I truly enjoy and want to pursue further.
Personally, I already have a clear goal for what I want to achieve in this course: to learn as much as I can and focus on developing skills that align with my passions. Specifically, I am eager to dive into backend development, particularly working with technologies such as Node.js and other backend platforms. I believe that gaining expertise in backend development will not only complement my existing knowledge but also open up new opportunities for me to contribute to building efficient systems. Backend development will help me to expand my knowledge to my studies and help me to understand more about this course.
3. Challenges and Areas for Improvement
As a student of this course (APPDEV), I have found working with databases to be one of the more difficult aspects of the course, especially since I have not had much experience with backend development prior to this. While I understand the basic concepts of databases, such as tables, relations, and queries, applying these concepts to real-world applications is still a challenge. Designing an efficient database schema that reflects the needs of an application, ensuring proper data normalization, and managing relationships between tables are areas where I need more practice. Despite these challenges I will seek help from instructors or peers. Collaboration and discussing challenges with others can often provide fresh insights and additional knowledge. By staying consistent with practice and actively engaging in the learning process, I believe I can improve my skills and overcome these challenges.
4. Expectations from the Instructor
As our instructor from the second year to this year, I can confidently say that you are an effective teacher. You helped us navigate and succeed in the course you are handling. Despite the challenges some of us face, especially with coding, where many of us struggle with complex concepts, you’ve always been there to support us. You’ve shown great patience and understanding, ensuring that each student receives the help they need, even when it’s difficult for some to keep up. Your efforts go beyond simply helping us survive the course; you are committed to ensuring we not only pass but also gain valuable knowledge and skills that we can carry into our future careers.With all of that I only expect you to remain the same as the instructor we've known from the start.
5. Final Thoughts 
As I mentioned in the previous questions, my main goal for this course is to learn as much as I can,  My learning preference is through hands-on experience, so I would appreciate more practical projects that will allow me to apply what I learn.
